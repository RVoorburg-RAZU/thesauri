# RAZU thesauri

Thesauri in RDF for the RAZU e-depot / digital repository.

## How to use

1. Use the turtle files in the `rdf` directory for updating the concepts.

2. Run `python tools/validate.py` to validate the RDF against a SHACL profile.

3. Run `python tools/ttl2json.py` to convert the turtle files to json (the prefered format for the repository)

4. Run `python tools/storeS3.py` to upload the generated json files to the `context`bucket in the S3 store.

5. Upload the files to the relevant datasets in the triplestore (documentation = TODO, automation = TODO).
Each thesaurus has its own dataset in the Triply environment. Each thesaurus is also uploaded to the id/object dataset to allow all data to be queried from a single SPARQL endpoint.

## Requirements

Make sure to load the requirements from `requirements.txt` before running the scripts.
For `storeS3.py`, [Razulibs](https://github.com/Regionaal-Archief-Zuid-Utrecht/razulibs) should be in the `$PYTHONPATH` environment variable, or installed in your python environment.

## TODO

- Add upload to triplestore
